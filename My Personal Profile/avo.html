<p>My Hobbies!<br>   I have many hobbies! the one which i do perfectly is painting.I have learnt painting from my childhood and for more than 5 years i went to a painting institute.Besides that i love to take photos and i myself think as a mini photographer . i got this painting interest from around my first class,i used to sit with a paper and pencil draw for hours and hours.But the interest in photography is little different.By seeing my friends and the way they take photos and the way people praise them,i liked it!.I even like editing the photos which i have taken.
